# RReducing Training Complexity of Learning Wireless Resource Allocation with Permutation Equivariant Prior Knowledge
Python codes to reproduce our works. 

Generate_data.m (Matlab code) is used to generate data. 

In run_FCNN.py and run_PENN.py, we do the training and testing stages for fully-connected and permutation equivalence neural networks, respectively.

All codes have been tested successfully on Python 3.6.0 with TensorFlow 1.14.0 and matlab 2019.
